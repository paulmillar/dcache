#   dCache will try to verify the integrity of transferred data by
#   comparing locally generated checksum values with that obtained
#   from the remote server.  If the transfer protocol is HTTP then RFC
#   3230 allows dCache to discover checksums for the remote file.
#   With this, dCache can learn if the file was corrupted during
#   transfer.  If the remote server supports RFC 3230 and the remote
#   server uses a compatible checksum algorithm then dCache will
#   always verify the data integrity.
#
#   Although dCache supports RFC 3230, most HTTP and WebDAV servers
#   currently do not.  It is also possible that, although the remote
#   server supports RFC 3230, the supplied checksum cannot be used by
#   dCache.  When transferring data with such a server, dCache can
#   either transfer the file's data without checksum verification or
#   fail the request.
#
#   The RequireChecksumVerification HTTP header allows the client to
#   control whether checksum verification is required.  dCache accepts
#   the this header with values of 'true' or 'false'.  If 'true' then
#   checksum verification is required for the transfers and the
#   failure to obtain a suitable checksum will fail the transfer.  If
#   'false' then dCache will still attempt to verify data integrety
#   but the transfer will not fail because of dCache was unable to
#   verify the data integrety by checking a checksum.
#
#   If the client does not specify RequireChecksumVerification as part
#   of the header then the following property's value is used as a
#   default.

webdav.net.listen = ${dcache.net.listen}

#  ---- What IP address to use for connections from the WebDAV door to pools

#   the internal connection created from the door to the pool.
#
(forbidden)webdavInternalAddress = Use webdav.net.listen
webdav.net.internal=

#  ---- Whether to redirect GET requests to a pool
#
#   If true, WebDAV doors will respond with a 302 redirect pointing to
#   a pool holding the file. This requires that a pool can accept
#   incoming TCP connections and that the client follows the
#   redirect. If false, data is relayed through the door. The door
#   will establish a TCP connection to the pool.

(one-of?true|false)webdav.redirect.on-read=true

#  ---- Whether to redirect PUT requests to a pool
#
#   If true, WebDAV doors will respond with a 307 redirect pointing to
#   a pool to which to upload the file. This requires that a pool can
#   accept incoming TCP connections and that the client follows the
#   redirect. If false, data is relayed through the door. The door
#   will establish a TCP connection to the pool. Only clients that send
#   a Expect: 100-Continue header will be redirected - other requests

#  ---- Whether existing files may be overwritten
#
#   The WebDAV protocol specifies that a PUT overwrites existing files
#   (but not directories). If this property is set to true, then
#   dCache honors this aspect of the WebDAV specification. If set to
#   false, attempts to overwrite existing files will be denied.

#
#   The webdav door restricts access to the user's root directory (as defined

#  ---- Trusted CA certificates

#   https as the webdav.authn.protocol, the CA certificates in

#  dCache comes with a default template.  Some elements of that

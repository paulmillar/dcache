#  ---- plugin list
#
#  A comma-separated list of missing-file plugins to enable.
#
#  When someone attempts to read a file that does not exist, plugins
#  are called in the list order.  The plugin may instruct the door to
#  fail the request, retry (e.g., if the plugin has been successful in
#  obtaining the file from a remote site) or defer to the next plugin
#  in the list.
#
#  If all plugins defer or no plugins are configured then the door is
#  instructed to fail the request.

#
#  Whether missing files support is enabled for this particular door.
#  If set to 'false' then requests for a file that is missing will
#  fail.  If set to 'true' then the door will ask the missing-files
#  service for a recommendation.  The behaviour of this service is
#  configurable: it may attempt to populate the file or may simply log
#  the failed attempt.

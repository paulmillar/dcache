#  ---- Java VM options
#
#  Properties that control the options to the Java VM instances.
#
#  There are two kinds of Java virtual machine instances: short-lived
#  and long-lived.
#
#  The short-lived invocations are expected to run as quickly as
#  possible and generally complete within a few seconds.
#
#  The long-lived invocations are the dCache domains.  These will have
#  the same duration as a dCache domain; i.e., many months or years.
#
#  dCache uses different Java options to hint to the JVM that the
#  different invocations have different expected lifetimes; for
#  example, short-lived invocations should favour startup speed over
#  long-term optimisation.
#
#  The JVM options used are dcache.java.options and
#  dcache.java.options.short-lived, both of which include
#  dcache.java.options.common.  In general, these three properties
#  should not be directly reconfigured, but site customisation should
#  be achieved through other properties.  In particular, additional
#  java command-line arguments may be added by configuring either the
#  dcache.java.options.extra or dcache.java.options.short-lived.extra
#  property (or both).

#  This property allows site-specific extra options that are used only
#  for long-lived JVM instances.

#   Various components can bind to a particular network interface.  The value of

#   '::1' for IPv6.
#
#   The address '0.0.0.0' listens on all interfaces for IPv4
#   connections and '::' listens on all interfaces for IPv6
#   connections (depending on the platform, an IPv4 address may be
#   converted to the equivalent IPv6 address and match '::').  The
#   keyword 'any' will listen on all interfaces.
#
#   If a hostname is specified, the name is resolved to an address and the service

#          Cell Communication
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#  ---- Which message broker implementation to use
#
#   Selects between various message brokers. The message broker
#   determines how dCache domains communicate with each other. Valid
#   values are:
#
#   'cells' is the classic cells based system. It relies on a central
#   location service that all domains connect to. The host, port and
#   domain of this service is defined by dcache.broker.host,
#   dcache.broker.port and dcache.broker.domain.
#
#   'none' no broker connection is establish. This is used for single
#   domain deployments.
#
(forbidden)broker.scheme = Use dcache.broker.scheme
(for-domains,one-of?cells|none)\
dcache.broker.scheme = cells


#  ---- Broker for interdomain communication
#
#   By default both the cells and the hybrid broker styles use a star
#   topology with all messages going through a central domain. This
#   domain is usually dCacheDomain, but any domain can be used.
#
#   As all other domains need to connect to the broker, broker.host
#   has to be configured throughout the dCache instance unless the
#   broker runs on the local host or if there is no broker.
#
#   Domains open a UDP port to listen for topology information.  The
#   information is sent from the ${dcache.broker.domain} domain.  The
#   port number that a domain listens for topology information is
#   configured by the dcache.broker.client.port property.  This is
#   either the port number or '0' (indicating a randomly chosen port
#   number).
#
#   NOTE: ${dcache.broker.client.port} must be EITHER a unique port
#   number OR '0'.  This means that it is almost certainly wrong to
#   configure this property anywhere other than in a domain's context
#   (i.e., immediately after declaring a domain).
#
#   Inter-domain messages are sent via TCP on port
#   ${dcache.broker.messaging.port}.  Since topology discovery uses
#   UDP, dcache.broker.port and dcache.broker.messaging.port may have
#   the same port number.

#  ---- Location of location manager configuration file
#
#   Only used when dcache.broker.scheme is cells and only by the
#   ${dcache.broker.domain} domain.  If the file doesn't exist then a
#   default 'star' topology is used, where the ${dcache.broker.domain}
#   domain accepts connections from all other domains and routes
#   messages accordingly.
#
#   If the ${dcache.broker.cells.config} file exists then it is read
#   by the lmd cell running in ${dcache.broker.domain} on startup.
#   This allows site-specific adjustments to the messaging topology.
#
#   Please note that adjusting the messaging topology is an advance
#   feature that few (if any) dCache deployments need to adjust.
#   Using a different messaging technology may be a preferable
#   solution; see dcache.broker.scheme property for the alternatives.

#  ---- Upload directory
#
#   Some protocols (currently just SRM) allow a client to upload a file and, once

#   atomic operation. Such uploads may be aborted before the final step without
#   there being any noticeable effect for other users.
#
#   To achieve this, dCache will point clients to upload files beneath the
#   dcache.upload-directory directory, which must be owned by root and have
#   permission mask 711.  The directory is created automatically if it does not
#   exist and must be accessible through all doors used for SRM uploading.
#
#   If this property is set to an absolute path, it is interpreted as an absolute
#   path in dCache's name space. If this directory is not exposed by a door, that
#   door cannot be used for upload by SRM. This would happen if a non-default root
#   directory has been defined for a door, or if a non-default root directory
#   has been defined for users.
#
#   There are three ways to resolve this problem:
#
#   - Change dcache.upload-directory to a directory that is within a part of
#     the name space exposed by all doors needed for SRM and for all accounts
#     using SRM. E.g. if
#
#           /pnfs/example.org/data
#
#     is the root of all your doors and all your accounts, then setting
#
#           dcache.upload-directory = /pnfs/example.org/data/upload
#
#     is the best solution. This needs to be done for pnfsmanager and all
#     doors.
#
#     If accounts have individual root directories, then this solution may not
#     be suitable.
#
#   - Add additional FTP doors for the SRM configured with
#
#        ftp.root = /
#
#     or
#
#        ftp.root = ${ftp.authz.upload-directory}
#
#     This will expose the upload directory and SRM will automatically
#     prefer these for uploads. This could be done in the same domain as
#     existing doors using a non-standard TCP port.
#
#   - Defined a relative upload directory. If this property is defined to
#     a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the account's root
#     directory. It will thus appear in the name space exposed by the FTP
#     door. There are two downsides to this:
#
#       * The upload directory may conflict with user files and directories.
#
#       * There will be several upload directories scattered throughout the
#         name space. This may make it more difficult to clean up in case
#         dCache fails to remove temporary upload directories.

#          Database Configuration
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   The current setup assumes that one or more PostgreSQL servers are
#   used by the various dCache components.  Database user and database
#   password are configurable. The dCache components use the databases 'dcache',
#   'replicas', 'companion' and 'billing'.  However, these might be located on
#   separate hosts.
#
#   The most performant configuration is to have the database server
#   running on the same host as the dCache component that will
#   access it.  Therefore, the default value for all the following
#   variables is 'localhost'.  Uncomment and change these variables
#   only if you have a reason to deviate from this scheme.
#
#   For example, one valid deployment would be to put the 'billing'
#   database on different host than the pnfs server database and
#   companion, but keep the httpDomain on the admin host.

#  ---- Whether to manage database schemas automatically
#
#   When true, database schemas will be automatically updated when
#   needed. Not all services support this setting. This settings
#   applies to a complete domain and must not be defined at the
#   service level.

#
#   The    tape   protection    feature   is    only    available   if

#   similarly  named file  containing a  list of  FQANs and  DNs whose
#   owners are allowed to stage files (i.e., to read files from dCache
#   that are stored only on tape).
#
#   Stage configuration can  be provided either on the  door or on the
#   PoolManager as described in the following two cases below:
#
#      1) stage configuration provided on the door
#         (remember to repeat the same configuration on each door):
#         dcache.authz.staging.pep=doors
#      2) stage configuration provided on the PoolManager:
#         dcache.authz.staging.pep=PoolManager
#

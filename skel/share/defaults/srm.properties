#
# Notice that this does not control the number of SRM transfers that
# can be active at any given time: An SRM transfer involves several
# requests by the client (eg srmPrepareToGet, srmStatusOfGetRequest,
# srmReleaseFiles).
#
# There is also a choice whether to process requests synchronously or
# asynchronously. If processed synchronously, the request is not answered
# until processed. This means that a thread is bound to the request for
# the duration of the request processing. If processed asynchronous,
# the thread is released right away and the client submits new requests
# to poll for the completion of the previously submitted request. This
# adds latency and increases authentication overhead, but frees thread
# and TCP connections. See srm.request.switch-to-async-mode-delay.

srm.limits.jetty.threads.queued.max = 500

# ---- Enable legacy socket closure
#
# GSI is layered on top of the SSL/TLS protocol. SSL/TLS specifies that
# if the server wants to close the connection, it is to send an SSL
# close notification to the client. Some clients consider this notification
# a fatal error and expect the server to instead abruptly close the socket.
#
# Setting this property to true causes the server to close the socket without
# sending a close notification first. This should be enabled if compatibility
# with these clients is required.
#
(one-of?true|false)srm.enable.legacy-close=true

# ---- Parameters for schedulable SRM requests
#
# The SRM specification allows some request types to be processed
# asynchronously. Rather than waiting for request processing to
# complete before getting a reply, the client receives a preliminary
# reply stating that the request is accepted with instructions to
# ask back for the result later. The SRM specification allows this
# mode of operation for the following requests:
#
#  o srmReserveSpace
#  o srmUpdateSpace
#  o srmChangeSpaceForFiles
#  o srmLs
#  o srmPrepareToGet
#  o srmPrepareToPut
#  o srmCopy
#  o srmBringOnline
#
# Except for srmUpdateSpace and srmChangeSpaceForFiles, dCache supports
# asynchronous processing for all these requests.
#
# These requests share a common lifecycle:
#
#  o SRM_REQUEST_QUEUED
#
#    The request is queued for processing. dCache is currently not processing
#    the request.
#
#  o SRM_REQUEST_INPROGRESS
#
#    dCache is processing the request.
#
#  o SRM_FILE_PINNED / SRM_SPACE_AVAILABLE
#
#    For srmPrepareToGet and srmPrepareToPut these states indicate
#    that a transfer URL has been prepared and the client is expected
#    to transfer the file.
#
#  o SRM_SUCCESS / SRM_FAILURE / SRM_RELEASED / SRM_ABORTED
#
#    Request has completed and is no longer active
#
# This lifecycle is controlled by the SRM request scheduler. A separate
# scheduler exists for each request type, allowing limits to be configured
# individually.
#
# The SRM specification supports bulk operations for the following requests:
#
#  o srmLs
#  o srmPrepareToGet
#  o srmPrepareToPut
#  o srmCopy
#  o srmBringOnline
#  o srmRm
#
# A single client request may apply to a large number of files. Internally,
# dCache treats each file in a schedulable bulk request individually. To be
# precise, the scheduling described above does not apply to the entire SRM
# request, but to each site URL in the request. This is also true for the
# configuration properties described below.
#
# srmRm isn't a schedulable request and thus the discussion above doesn't
# apply to it.


# ---- Number of threads executing schedulable SRM requests
#
# Thread pool size for processing schedulable SRM requests. Most processing
# is done asynchronously and a low number of threads suffices to serve even
# thousands of concurrent requests. The notable exception are srmCopy and srmLs
# requests; these should be served by a thread pool equal to the number of
# inprogress requests allowed.
#
# This setting should not be confused with srm.limits.jetty.threads.min and
# srm.limits.jetty.threads.max. Those settings control the number of threads
# used by the embedded webserver; those threads are used for all client requests,
# schedulable and unschedulable requests alike, even status queries. Schedulable
# requests are however quickly handed over to the request scheduler and the
# web server thread is released (see srm.request.switch-to-async-mode-delay).
# Another difference is that for bulk requests, the webserver thread is bound
# to the entire request, while the scheduler threads process individual SURLs.

#
# The setting is a good measure of how much load the SRM can induce directly
# on other services in dCache, such as pnfs manager and pin manager.
#
# Notably, this setting limits the number of files that can be brought online
# simultaneously for get and bring-online requests, and the number of concurrent
# srmCopy transfers.
#
# The setting does NOT limit the number of concurrent upload and downloads. In
# SRM, srmPrepareToPut and srmPrepareToGet do not actually transfer a file: They
# prepare a transfer URL so that the client can transfer a file. Once the transfer
# URL has been prepared, the requests are no longer considered in progress (see
# srm.request.max-transfers).

# ---- Number of simultaneous transfer URLs
#
# This limits the number of TURLs to hand out to clients. If this limit is reached,
# additional requests will be queued after having been prepared.
#
# Note that clients may not actually transfer the file right after receiving a
# TURL. Many advanced clients check out TURLs ahead of time and queue transfers
# to and from those TURLs. Thus the actual number of transfers observed on dCache
# doors may be lower than the number TURLs handed out to the client.
#
# Note that this setting does not apply to srmCopy requests. Such requests do
# not have a TURL as the transfer is done by dCache and not by the client. To
# control the number of concurrent copies use srm.request.copy.max-inprogress or
# the settings of the transfermanagers service.

#
# ---- Third-party transfers
#
#  Third-party copying is when a client requests that data is sent
#  between this dCache cluster and some other storage system without
#  that client acting as an intermediate for the flow of data.
#
#  With a third-party copy initiatied through the SRM protocol, the
#  client may either specify a protocol-specific endpoint (e.g.,
#  'https://storage.example.org/path/to/remote-file'), or an SRM
#  endpoint (e.g., 'srm://storage.example.org/path/to/remote-file').
#  If an SRM endpoint is specified then dCache will negotiate with the
#  remote server to find the best available transfer protocol.
#
#  dCache will try to verify the integrity of transferred data by
#  comparing locally generated checksum values with that obtained from
#  the remote server.  If the transfer did not use the SRM protocol
#  then checksums can only be obtained via the transfer protocol.
#
#  If the transfer protocol is HTTP then RFC 3230 allows dCache to
#  discover checksums for the remote file.  With this, dCache can
#  learn if the file was corrupted during transfer.  If the remote
#  server supports RFC 3230 and the remote server uses a compatible
#  checksum algorithm then dCache will always verify the data
#  integrity.
#
#  Although dCache supports RFC 3230, most HTTP and WebDAV servers
#  currently do not.  It is also possible that, although the remote
#  server supports RFC 3230, the supplied checksum cannot be used by
#  dCache.  When transferring data with such a server, dCache can
#  either transfer the file's data without checksum verification or
#  fail the request.
#
#  The SRM protocol allows the client to steer the transfer by setting
#  ExtraInfo options.  dCache accepts the 'verify' ExtraInfo option
#  with a value of 'true' or 'false'.  If 'true' then checksum
#  verification is required for the transfers and the failure to
#  obtain a suitable checksum will fail the transfer.  If 'false' then
#  dCache will still attempt to verify data integrety but the transfer
#  will not fail because of dCache was unable to verify the data
#  integrety by checking a checksum.  See SRM client documentation for
#  details on how to set ExtraInfo options.
#
#  If the client leaves this option unspecified then the following
#  property's value is used as a default.
#
(one-of?true|false)srm.enable.third-party.requiring-verification-by-default = true

#
#  SRM ping ExtraInfo
#
#  The SRM 'ping' command allows the client to check that the server
#  is alive.  In addition to demonstrating the basic health of the
#  server, the response contains information as a list of key-value
#  pairs.
#
#  Sites can provide additional information by configuring properties
#  with a name that starts 'srm.ping-extra-info!'.  The ExtraInfo key
#  is the property name without this prefix and the ExtraInfo value is
#  the property's value.
#
(prefix)srm.ping-extra-info = The ExtraInfo items in an srmPing response.
srm.ping-extra-info!backend_type = dCache

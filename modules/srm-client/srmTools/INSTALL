Build environment for srmTools was taken from environment
for building samples for GSI plugin for gSOAP. 
Therefore, check INSTALL.gsiPlugin

Basicly, you need to do the following:

1) Get source.
 a) "cvs checkout srm/srmTools"  from DESY cvs repository.
 b) "cvs checkout srm/GlobusFix" -"- if you are using Globus 2.4 (or probably later)
 
2) set environment:
 GLOBUS_LOCATION
 XERCES_DIR
-- ups does it for you.

3) Fix globus: 
 a) IF you use globus 2.2.4, uncomment line in Makefile.am:
 DEFINE +=_I_USE_GLOBUS_VERSION_2_2_4_
else
 b) IF you use globus 2.4, check EXTERN_C_BEGIN is present in globus_debug.h file
  if not, checkout GlobusFix above and fix "globus_debug.h" file in your globus installation.
  
Then:

*) autoreconf --force
*) ./configure
*) make init
*) make

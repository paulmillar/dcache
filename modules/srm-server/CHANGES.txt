More database schema changes, use integer type as a primary key for user
credential storage. Need to drop the tables as described bellow again.

Wednesday 23 March 2005
Space Reservation is ready in its first approximation. It wolks only with the
dcache implementation and is not implemented for unix fs srm.
please see the dcache specific CHANGES.txt for dcache configuration.

Wednesday 9 March 2005

Added more database integrity checks, added more space reservation code.
Added one more field to copyfile request, please cleanup database as described
bellow

Tuesday 1 March 2005

Modified the database scema to increase database operations performance
and to account for reserved space
all database tables created previously should be manually removed

foollow the following steps to remove the tables :
1. locacate configuration file  srm.batch for dcache srm or config.xml for
file system srm and find values of  parameters jdbcUrl, jdbcUser and jdbcPass
the last element of the jdbc url is your database name, for example if the 
value of jdbcUrl is dbc:postgresql://host/dcache then the name of the 
database is dcache.
Use these parameters and "psql" postgress client to connect to the sql server:

$psql -U <user> -h <host> <database name>

once psql connects to the server you will see the command prompt that looks
like that:
dbname=>
Execute the following commands (you can just cut andpaste the following text
into the psql):
DROP TABLE  copyfilerequests ;
DROP TABLE  copyfilerequests_b ;
DROP TABLE  copyrequests ;
DROP TABLE  copyrequests_b ;
DROP TABLE  getrequests_protocols ;
DROP TABLE  getrequests_protocols_b ;
DROP TABLE  getfilerequests ;
DROP TABLE  getfilerequests_b ;
DROP TABLE  getrequests ;
DROP TABLE  getrequests_b ;
DROP TABLE  putrequests_protocols ;
DROP TABLE  putrequests_protocols_b ;
DROP TABLE  putfilerequests ;
DROP TABLE  putfilerequests_b ;
DROP TABLE  putrequests ;
DROP TABLE  putrequests_b ;
DROP TABLE  srmrequestcredentials ;

You are done.

Moved the srm code to the "srm" repository, now in order to build 
dcache with srm, we need to copy the jar files and globus, glue and axis directories from the srm/lib directory, after building srm, also the dcache classpath now needs to include the srm.jar jar file. Also the srm lib directory contains the mapfile SRMServerV1.map. this will need to be put in the dcache config directory and given to srm dcache cell via an option : "-srmmap=${config}/SRMServerV1.map"
 
Friday 07 January 2004

The client part used for performance of srm copy requests (srm to srm 
negotiation part) switched from using the glue soap toolkit from "The 
Mind Electric" to Apache Axis soap toolkit. Now the srm will connect 
directly to the web service host, skipping the wsdl parsing step. As a
result, the srm urls corresponding to castor srm will now be different.
dcache srm urls will remain the same. The old way of connection to srm
service is still available and can be activated by addition of
"-connect_to_wsdl=true" to the srm cell options. New srmcp client is
available as well. dcache classpath definition in dCacheSetup now needs
to be appended with the paths to all axis jar files in classes/axis
directory and with a path to cog-axis.jar in globus directory.

Added the true support to the optional specification o the web service 
enpoint path specification in srm url. The  path part of srm url can now 
consist of two parts, path to the service, and path
to the file, separated by "?SFN=" part. For example in srm url
"srm://fnisd1:8443//srm/managerv1?SFN=/pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/test", the web
service path is /srm/managerv1 and the file path is /pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/test

Modified the database schema so that the active and competed requests are
stored in ceparate tables. this should prevent the srm execution slowdown,
after the number of records grows beyond some limit.
Upon upgrade you need to delete all srm tables to allow the srm to recreate 
them according to the new schema!!!!

Rebuilt the latest jglobus jars, using the jglobus cvs. Updated the jar files in classes/globus directory. The classpath definition in the dcache config file dCacheSetup needs to be updated to include the paths to all the jar files in globus directory.
For example it might look like this:
classpath=${thisDir}/../classes/dcache-srm.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/glue/GLUE-STD.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/glue/dom.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/glue/servlet.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/glue/jnet.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/glue/jsse.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/glue/jsert.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/pgjdbc2.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/javatunnel.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/junit.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/cog-jglobus.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/cog-url.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/cryptix32.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/cryptix-asn1.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/cryptix.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/jce-jdk13-125.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/jgss.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/junit.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/log4j-1.2.8.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/globus/puretls.jar:${thisDir}/../classes/concurrent.jar

Moved the Gsi ftp transfer manager service from doors directory to cervices directory, the class name chaged from diskCacheV111.doors.RemoteGsiftpTransferManager to diskCacheV111.services.GsiftpTransferManager. The batch files starting the service needs to be updated accordingly. Please see the INSTALL.txt for detailed installation instructions.

Moved the mover for the Gsi ftp transfer manager from srm/movers directory to the standard movers directory. As a result no mover map difinition is needed for remote gridftp transfer manager protocol in pool.batch. If you have this line in your pool.batch:
 
   movermap define RemoteGsiftpTransfer-1 diskCacheV111.srm.movers.RemoteGsiftpTransferProtocol_1

 then you can safely remove it.
